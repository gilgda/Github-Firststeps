###How-to make changes to the project
- Open your Command-Line at your project's location
- Type: `git pull` to download all changes from the remote
- Now you can change any files
- If you finish, you type: `git add .` in the Command-Line (adds every new/changed file)
- After this step you have to commit your changes: `git commit -m "Your commit message"` (Choose a suitable message like this: http://goo.gl/U2hMgE)
- These changes were only locally. To update your remote you type: `git push`
